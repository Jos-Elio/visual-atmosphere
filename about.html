                        Jos Elio Angel works as an independent producer and songwriter based in Leipzig, Germany. He writes, composes, records, produces, mixes and masters music.
                        His compositions are a mixture of recorded analog instruments and sounds like guitar, voice and field recordings,
                        and of digital software instruments like synthesizers, strings, bass, drums and effects.
                        In a broader sense his songs are in the pop genre.

                    <p>
                        <em>Visuals:</em>
                        For his own live music shows he creates colorful, ambient visuals consisting of found footage and selfmade video clips.
                        Through varying light intensities and colors, and a visual highlighting of excerpts of the lyrics of the songs,
                        the live shows offer an immersive space.
